# Pseudo Code from Chapter 4

This folder contains the files with the pseudo code from Chapter 4 in the thesis.
The code is written as Matlab translations of the algorithms in [[1]](#1), i.e. not fully pseudo code,
but not fully working code either.

Click [here](https://friedlander.io/spgl1/) for the working SPGL1 code by Michael P. Friedlander and Ewout van den Berg.
